# LIBGDX Platformer

Project for Mobile Software Development Course at Unitec in 2018.
I tried to create a simple platformer game using libGDX that could be run on android.
Unfortunately, the project was unable to be completed fully prior to deadline of the assignment and no further changes are likely to be made.

## Technologies

- libGDX 1.9.8
- Java

## Install

This project was created using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/).
So, I guess that would reccomened to have them to run this project.
