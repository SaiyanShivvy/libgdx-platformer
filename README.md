# LIBGDX Platformer

Project for Mobile Software Development Course at Unitec in 2018.
I tried to create a simple platformer game using libGDX that could be run on android.

## Project Status
Unfortunately, the project was unable to be completed fully prior to deadline of the assignment and no further changes are likely to be made.

## Technologies

The Project was made using:

- libGDX 1.9.8
- Java

## Install

This project was created using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/).
So, I guess that would reccomened to have them to run this project.

## Usage

- Download and Extract this Project. 
- Open Android Studio and Select the Project from the downloaded location. The folder itself should be recognized by Android Studio.
- Let the Android Studio build the project (may take a while).
- Click 'Run android' from 'Run' menu.

> Preview

## Notes

Desktop Launcher doesn't work because it's running an older version of Gradle and is now deprecated.
Android Launcher still seems to work.
There are still bugs and doesn't completely work but is runnable.
